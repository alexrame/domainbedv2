       " \"I want to use UTC dates in my Node.js backend app, however, I need to be able to set time (hours and minutes) in a local/user-specified timezone.\\n\\nI am looking for a solution in either pure JS or using `dayjs`. I am not looking for a solution in `moment`.\\n\\nIt seemed like using `dayjs` I could solve this problem quite easily, however, I could not find a way to accomplish this.\\n\\nI can use UTC timezone by using [`dayjs.utc()`](https://day.js.org/docs/en/plugin/utc) or using [`dayjs.tz(someDate, 'Etc/UTC')`](https://day.js.org/docs/en/timezone/timezone).\\n\\nWhen using `dayjs.utc()`, I cannot use/specify other timezones for *anything*, therefore I could not find a way to tell `dayjs` I want to set hours/minutes in a particular (non-UTC) timezone.\\n\\nWhen using `dayjs.tz()`, I still cannot define a timezone of time I want to set to a particular date.\\n\\n### Example in plain JS\\n\\nMy locale timezone is `Europe/Slovakia` (CEST = UTC+02 with DST, CET = UTC+1 without DST), however, I want this to work with any timezone.\\n\\n```js\\n// Expected outcome\\n// old: 2022-10-29T10:00:00.000Z\\n// new time: 10h 15m CEST\\n// new: 2022-10-29T08:15:00.000Z\\n\\n// Plain JS\\nconst now = new Date('2022-10-29T10:00:00.000Z')\\nconst hours = 10\\nconst minutes = 15\\nnow.setHours(10)\\nnow.setMinutes(15)\\n\\n// As my default timezone is `Europe/Bratislava`, it seems to work as expected\\nconsole.log(now)\\n// Output: 2022-10-29T08:15:00.000Z\\n\\n// However, it won't work with timezones other than my local timezone\\n\\n```\\n\\n### (Nearly) a solution\\n\\n***Update: I posted a working function in [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74245936/3408342).***\\n\\nThe following functions seems to work for most test cases, however, it fails for 6 4 cases known to me (any help is greatly appreciated):\\n\\n* [DST to ST] `now` in DST before double hour, `newDate` in ST during double hour;\\n* [DST to ST] `now` in DST during double hour, `newDate` in ST during double hour;\\n* [DST to ST] `now` in ST during double hour, `newDate` in DST during double hour;\\n* [DST to ST] `now` in ST after double hour, `newDate` in DST during double hour;\\n* [ST to DST] `now` in ST before skipped hour, `newDate` in ST in skipped hour;\\n* [ST to DST] `now` in DST after skipped hour, `newDate` in ST in skipped hour.\\n\\nI think the only missing piece is to find a way to check if a particular date in a non-UTC timezone falls into double hour. By *double hour* I mean a situation caused by changint DST to ST, i.e. setting our clock back an hour (e.g. at 3am to 2am → double hour is between `02:00:00.000` and `02:59:59.999`, which occur both

I'd like to implement a system where people are not required to be online to use the software. I can imagine having contracts that return themselves as valid while offline, but will nodes provide access to data if they are not sync'd up? I'd be ok using out of date data for up to a month or more, but I'd need the local client to respond.\\n\\nAlternatively, I could create local license files from the node when the node is online, but I could almost as easily email license files. But by using the blockchain, the licenses and other assets could be traded and available should the company fold.\",\n",
       " \"I ask this as someone who loves maths but has no ability. So 2 axioms & a question.\\n\\nAxiom 1 - a digital processor exists that can find the n'th prime number of any size instantly.\\nAxiom 2 - all natural numbers can be expressed as the sum of 2 primes.\\n\\nWould it take more/less/same amount of bits to define a natural number exactly as the sum of primes or as traditional POW2 digital format and will that fact apply to all natural numbers whatever their size? I presume a +/- wouldn't be needed because if it's a - then the larger prime is given first. I'm also interested to know if it's ALWAYS more/less efficient or is their a numerical point at which the optimal solution alters.\\n\\nMaybe it's a very badly written question. If so, I can only apologise. I have wondered this for 20 years but never had anywhere to ask. Thanks.\",\n",
       " \"I'm working through Example 2.22 in Steward and Tall's Algebraic Number Theory book. The goal is to determine the ring of integers of $\\\\mathbb Q(\\\\sqrt[3]5)$. Let $\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb R$ such that $\\\\theta^3=5$. Let $\\\\omega=e^{2\\\\pi i/3}$. I'm at the point where I need to check whether\\n$$\\n\\\\alpha=\\\\frac 13(1+\\\\theta+\\\\theta^2)\\n$$\\nor\\n$$\\n\\\\beta=\\\\frac 13(2+2\\\\theta+2\\\\theta^2)\\n$$\\nare algebraic integers (I've checked the other cases). Let's start with $\\\\alpha$. I can think of two ways to do this. The first would be to consider the norm\\n$$\\nN(\\\\alpha)=\\\\frac 1{27}(1+\\\\theta+\\\\theta^2)(1+\\\\omega\\\\theta+\\\\omega^2\\\\theta^2)(1+\\\\omega^2\\\\theta+\\\\omega\\\\theta^2).\\n$$\\nIf $\\\\alpha$ is an algebaric integer, then $N(\\\\alpha)\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z$. However, the expression of $N(\\\\alpha)$ is a bit complicated (unless I'm overlooking something). The second would be to determine the minimum polynomial $\\\\mu$ of $\\\\alpha$ over $\\\\mathbb Q$, and then invoke that $\\\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer iff $\\\\mu\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z[X]$.\\n\\nIn both cases I'm not too hopeful. Should I still proceed in this way, or is there something obvious I'm missing?\",\n",

The page I load changes depending on the status of the `req.session.user` in this way:\\n\\n```\\napp.get(\\'/\\', function(req, res){\\n    if(req.session.user){\\n        res.render(__dirname + \\'/pages/base.jade\\', {});\\n    }\\n    else{\\n        res.render(__dirname + \\'/pages/login_register.jade\\', {});\\n    }\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf `req.session.user` is null I send a page in which the user can do the login or register. If he/she does a login, this is what happens in the server:\\n\\n```\\napp.post(\\'/login\\', function(req, res){\\n    var user = {};\\n    user.username = req.body.username;\\n    user.password = req.body.password;\\n    checkLogin(user, function(foundUser){\\n        //login correct\\n        console.log(\"login!\");\\n        req.session.user = foundUser;\\n        res.render(__dirname + \\'/pages/base.jade\\', {\\n        });\\n    });\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\nSo if the user logs in correctly `req.session.user` should be set with the credentials of the current user. The problem is that once I log in and then close the popup of the Chrome extension, whenever I reopen it I still receive the login page.\\n\\nMy question is: does the popup supports session storage in the express.js server?

Also, I don\\'t want to replicate the usernames and passwords from the aspnet\\\\_ tables to my table and maintain the data. \\n\\nI\\'m considering using a view to join them. Is this a good idea?\\n\\nThanks in advance!\\n\\nEDIT: From the answer, I see that I may not be clear enough, what I want. The question is not IF to use the default asp.net provider, but how to adopt it, to my needs.',\n",

       " 'For most ML models we say they suffer from high bias or high variance, then we correct for it. However, in DL do neural networks suffer from the same concept in the sense that they initially have high bias or high variance and then you correct through regularization and/or dropout? I would argue they initially suffer from high variance and they overfit the data. Then you correct through regularization, add dropout, image pre-processing in the case of CNNs, etc. Is this train of thought correct?',\n",

I mean, if you deal them all then you\\'ll just know what\\'s in your opponent\\'s hand?\\n\\nThis is going to sound trivial, but actually it\\'s part of this theory/hypothesis I have for this anime/manga series [The Quintessential Quintuplets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quintessential_Quintuplets), where I think the game Sevens(/Fan Tan/Domino) is symbolic of something in the series (namely something to do with the number 7). My thought is that the card game Sevens (and thus the number 7) is so important that it even leads to a mistake like this. So if this were a mistake, then it\\'s possible that Sevens is really important. Or something.\\n\\n* Actually there have been previous discussions of the game Sevens in this series.

Japanese variation of Sevens. In the upper right part of the Wikipedia page, you can see that it says 3-8 players, so I guess that includes the Japanese Sevens.\\n\\nYou can even see how the cards are laid out that they really are playing (some variation of) Sevens.\\n\\nOther notes:\\n\\n1. I\\'ve read only a bit of the manga, but I\\'m pretty sure no other kids were playing with the 2.\\n2. Additionally, Sevens has been played earlier in the series ([S01E09](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RReaF.jpg) where it\\'s still Shichi Narabe [7並べ], but it\\'s translated as \\'Fan Tan\\' instead of \\'Sevens\\', again by both the English dub and the subtitles for the original Japanese), but there were at least 3 players then.',\n",

Hence the power set of A union B will contain a set that has more elements than A or B.\\n\\nHence, P(A union B) is not a subset of P(A) union P(B).\\n\\n(ii) I got 4 cases to consider.\\n\\nConsider both the case A is not a subset of B and A is not equal to B.\\n\\nThen, both cases will have the same argument that A union B will have more elements than A and more elements than B. Hence, the power set of (A union B) will contain a set that has more elements than A or B. Hence, P(A) union P(B) is a subset of P(A union B).\\n\\nConsider the case A is a subset of B.\\n\\nIf A is a subset of B, thus A union B = B. Therefore, all the elements in A union B will be inside B. Thus the power set of (A union B) will be the same as the power set of B.\\nAlso since A is a subset of B, elements in A will be in B as well. Therefore, Power set of A is a subset of Power set of B. Since Power set of A is a subset of Power set of B, power set of (A union B) equals to power set of B, thus, P(A U B) = P(B) = P(A) U P(B),\\nhence P(A) U P(B) is a subset of P(A U B).\\n\\nConsider the case B is a subset of A.\\n\\nIf B is a subset of A, thus A U B = A. Therefore all the elements in A U B will be in A. Thus the power set of ( A U B ) will be the same as P ( A ).\\nAlso , since B is a subset of A, elements in B will be in A as well. Therefore, P( B ) is a subset of P ( A ). Since P(B) is a subset of P(A), P(A) U P(B) = P(A). \\nThus, P(A U B) = P(A) = P(A) U P(B),\\nhence P(A) U P(B) is a subset of P(A U B).\\n\\n*Do i need to consider the case of null sets?*',\n",

I say this because a lot of times pop songs I see people post the progressions for, (usually 4 chord progressions that do not change during the song) some people list the major key and some list the minor key. For example lets use the song \"Wake Me Up\" -- A lot of people post the songs progression as a VI, IV, I, V and in the key of D. But other websites classify the song as in the key of Bm with the progression I, VI, III, VII.\\n\\nMy personal opinion would be that the song begins with Bm So I would say it\\'s in the key of Bm following a I, VI, III, VII. If it had started on a D and modulated to Bm I\\'d say its in the key of D--- I\\'m I correct in saying this? Can you always class the song in two different keys since you can rewrite the progression differently but use the same chords? pls help :(',\n",

They all come to these same solutions:\\n\\n1. Use a UIToolbar with translucent set to YES, and then set its barTintColor property. The problem with this approach is that it significantly increases the lightness of the color. This is the approach that [AMBlurView](https://github.com/JagCesar/iOS-blur) uses. The nav bar in the Facebook app remains dark blue even when it's above white content. (with AMBlurView it becomes pastel blue)\\n2. Render the underlying view's in a graphic context, then blur that context, output it as a UIImage and use that as background view, repeat 30 times per second. (which hurts performance pretty bad).

Even if i try to remap the table space or schemas, the value of sequence shows a lesser value than rows in their respective tables. Due to which when i access the application it throws an error while saving the data.\\n\\nI am confused and don't getting an idea to solve this. Please advise.\\nIs their any method to solve this issue?\\n\\nThanks in advance.\",\n",

This is a moderately old TV, 2007 era, non-smart.\\n\\nOriginally, I tried to hook it up to my laptop, to no avail. I'll save you the long story of all the bug hunting I did, but eventually I came to the discovery that it's not the computer(s) at fault, nor the cable: the TV itself is not recognizing any HDMI from either my laptop or my desktop. My laptop, running win10, and later Win8.1 (after reading in some places win10 and HDMI have known to not play nice) was unable to get a link to the TV, and my desktop is also not able to output to it, or even recognize a screen is connected. Oddly enough, if I hook up, say, a cable box, to the same HDMI ports on the TV, using the same cable, I do get output, and if I for instance use the same HDMI cable and plug it into one of my computer monitors, the computer picks it up fine. It's literally only PC to TV that will NOT work. I've tried onboard graphics, I've tried my GTX970, I've tried old drivers, new drivers, I've factory resetted the TV, it won't budge. Nothing is working. I've tried literally everything I can think of. The only thing I can imagine is happening is that maybe the PCs are all outputting some format the TV won't recognize (which already seems unlikely, especially through HDMI), but then at least I would still imagine my computer to at least *notice* a screen is connected.\\n\\nIs there *anyone* who has *any* idea what the hell is going on?\\n\\nfurther info: desktop is Win10 and is also running two other monitors off of the GTX970, both are connected through DVI.
